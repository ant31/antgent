# CI/CD and Deployment

This document provides a high-level overview of the continuous integration, continuous deployment (CI/CD), and deployment processes for the antgent project.

**Note:** This is a general guide. Specific details may vary based on the current infrastructure setup.

## Continuous Integration (CI)

Our CI pipeline is designed to ensure code quality, correctness, and consistency before changes are merged into the main branch. The pipeline is typically triggered on every push to a feature branch or pull request.

Key stages of the CI pipeline include:

1.  **Linting and Formatting**:
    *   **`ruff`**: Runs a comprehensive suite of linting and formatting checks to catch potential bugs, style issues, and inconsistencies.
    These checks are also available as a pre-commit hook to catch issues before code is even pushed.

2.  **Unit and Integration Tests**:
    *   **`make test`**: Runs the full test suite using `pytest`. This includes unit tests for individual components and integration tests that verify how different parts of the system work together.
    *   **Code Coverage**: The test suite also generates a code coverage report to ensure that we maintain a high level of test coverage for new and existing code.

3.  **Build**:
    *   The pipeline builds a Docker image for the application, which packages the application code, its dependencies, and the necessary runtime environment. This ensures that the application runs in a consistent environment across development, testing, and production.

A pull request can only be merged if all stages of the CI pipeline pass successfully.

## Continuous Deployment (CD)

Once changes are merged into the main branch, our CD pipeline automates the process of deploying the new version of the application to our various environments.

### Environments

We typically use the following environments:

-   **Development**: An environment for developers to test their features in an integrated setting. Deploys to this environment may be manual or triggered automatically from feature branches.
-   **Staging**: A pre-production environment that mirrors the production setup as closely as possible. Deploys to staging are usually triggered automatically after a merge to the main branch. This is where final end-to-end testing and QA are performed.
-   **Production**: The live environment accessible to users. Deploys to production are typically a manual, controlled step, often performed after successful verification in the staging environment.

### Deployment Process

The CD pipeline generally performs the following steps:

1.  **Tagging**: A new Git tag (e.g., `v0.2.1`) is created for the release.
2.  **Build and Push Docker Image**: The Docker image built during the CI phase is pushed to a container registry (e.g., AWS ECR, Docker Hub) and tagged with the release version.
3.  **Deploy to Staging**: The new Docker image is deployed to the staging environment. This might involve updating a Kubernetes deployment, an ECS service, or another container orchestration platform.
4.  **Deploy to Production**: After verification on staging, the same Docker image is promoted to the production environment. This is often a manual trigger to ensure a controlled release process.

This automated pipeline allows us to deliver new features and fixes to users quickly and reliably while maintaining high standards of quality and stability.
