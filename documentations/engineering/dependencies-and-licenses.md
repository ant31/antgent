# Dependencies and Licenses

This project relies on a number of open-source libraries. We are committed to using licenses that are compatible with our project's goals and legal requirements.

## License Policy

We aim to use permissive licenses (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0, BSD) whenever possible. Copyleft licenses that may impose legal difficulties (such as GPL, AGPL, LGPL) are generally avoided and require a specific review and approval process.

## License Compliance

To ensure compliance, we use the `pip-licenses` tool to automatically check the licenses of all our dependencies. This check is integrated into our CI/CD pipeline and will fail if a non-approved license is introduced.

## Dependency Report

The following report is automatically generated and lists all dependencies and their licenses. It can be regenerated by running `make license-report`.
